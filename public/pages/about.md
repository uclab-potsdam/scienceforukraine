# About

## Mission Statement


#ScienceForUkraine is a community group of volunteer students and research scientists from academic institutions in Europe and around the world.

Our mission is to collect and disseminate information about support opportunities at the university, national, and international level for graduate students and researchers directly affiliated to an academic institution in Ukraine.

We are grateful for support from [NEP4DISSENT COST Action](https://nep4dissent.eu/), [Institute of Literature, Folklore and Art of the University of Latvia](http://lulfmi.lv/en/news) and the [Polish Young Academy - Polish Academy of Sciences](https://amu.pan.pl/en/). Other institutions, networks and initiatives we partner with are listed [here](./partners.html).

To collect some success stories of displaced and refugee scholars from Ukraine we have started a [thread on Twitter](https://twitter.com/i/events/1519372075504484352).
