# How You Can Help

### How to submit a support offer?

*   Please use this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdcyWM6L1ee-lI5ByMUDx6RBDskCLxvKDQ_yRqOr344wKAR9g/viewform).
*   Additionally, post the information about the support on your website! Provide as many details as possible including email and other contact details, so where people in need can get in touch.
*   For corrections or deletions please [send an email](mailto:data@scienceforukraine.eu).

### What positions do you collect?

We are collecting opportunities which were exclusively created for scientists affected by the war in Ukraine or those in which they are encouraged to apply. Industrial R&D or similar positions are also welcome. This includes positions that relate to _paid positions_ or other forms of support that normally _costs money_ and which are dedicated to scholars and students affiliated to an academic institution in Ukraine.

Examples include:

*   Fellowship/scholarship
*   Research visit
*   Part time/full time employment
*   Accommodation in a dormitory or institution guest quarters
*   Support for accompanying family members
*   Office space
*   Computer with internet access
*   Access to library and/or lab facilities

Possibilities for **remote work** are particularly relevant as well. Please see [this letter](https://scienceforukraine.eu/assets/YSC_letter.pdf) of the Young Scientists Council at the Ministry of Education and Science in Ukraine to the Polish National Science Center and #ScienceForUkraine [press release](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KIO96sfir9oPkVOOKtxXzzx4iPr2_d_-/view) on remote work opportunities.

Support for Ukrainians on all levels of scholarly career is welcome: students, PhD candidates, early career researchers and senior scholars.

### Why should my institution provide support?

*   Because scholars should help their colleagues in need
*   To help people fleeing the conflict sustain themselves while abroad by doing what they know and love to do
*   To prevent scholarly careers from breaking due to unjustified atrocity
*   To sustain Ukraine’s presence in the European Research Area and international scholarly community
*   To benefit from a contribution of talented scholars in your institution or research team

### When should we open the call for applicants?

*   Right now or as soon as possible. People are fleeing the warzone and need some form of stability right away
*   We recommend that the whole process of applying, evaluating, providing results and funding should be immediate or contained in a few weeks’ timespan

### How long should the support last?

Given the uncertain situation we suggest that the support should be provided for the longest possible period, but not shorter than 3 months. This might include research visits, so that scholars gain time and means to apply for more stable positions or grants.

### Are non-Ukrainian citizens also eligible?

Yes. Please reach out to the potential hosts and explain your situation. Please note that most of the offers we received are for temporary hosting while the war is going on, and not for a permanent transfer to a university in some other country. If that is your goal, you would need to go through the standard immigration process.

### What about the students and scholars from Russia and Belarus?

This initiative is aimed at students and scholars who had to flee Ukraine because their lives are in immediate danger. Russia and Belarus generally do not have that status.

We are aware that many researchers in Russia/Belarus have not supported the previous annexation of Ukrainian territories and do not support the ongoing war, and have spoken out against it (see e.g. the [story](https://meduza.io/en/feature/2022/03/02/why-no-mass-protests-in-russia) of sociologist Grigori Yudin who ended up with a concussion after protesting). Similarly to Ukrainians who are granted refugee status if they manage to escape the war zone, Russian/Belarussian scholars generally can apply for [asylum](https://meduza.io/cards/kak-rossiyane-i-ukraintsy-mogut-poluchit-politicheskoe-ubezhische-v-evrope) (generally this needs a proof of arrests, threats, physical violence, being put on trial etc.). The researchers or students granted political asylum are welcome to reach out to the hosts and explain their situation. Those who left Russia/Belarus on general terms are encouraged to seek employment through regular channels.

Unfortunately we cannot assist either Ukrainian or Russian/Belorussian scholars with the most difficult part, i.e. reaching safety. We recommend the [Scholars At Risk network](https://www.scholarsatrisk.org/).
