# How You Can Help

## What forms of support are expected?

There are a variety of ways in which you can help and even the smallest support makes a difference. We include listings that relate to *paid positions* or other forms of support that normally *costs money* and which are dedicated to scholars and students affiliated to an academic institution in Ukraine. Examples include:

- Fellowship/scholarship
- Research visit
- Part time/full time employment
- Accommodation in a dormitory or institution guest quarters
- Support for accompanying family members
- Office space
- Computer with internet access
- Access to library and/or lab facilities

We are collecting opportunities which were exclusively created for scientists affected by the conflict in Ukraine or those in which they are encouraged to apply. Industrial R&D or similar positions are also welcome.

Possibilities for **remote work** are particularly relevant as well. Please see [this letter](https://scienceforukraine.eu/assets/YSC_letter.pdf) of the Young Scientists Council at the Ministry of Education and Science in Ukraine to the Polish National Science Center and #ScienceForUkraine [press release](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KIO96sfir9oPkVOOKtxXzzx4iPr2_d_-/view) on remote work opportunities.

## Why should your institution provide support?

- Because scholars should help their colleagues in need
- To help people fleeing the conflict sustain themselves while abroad by doing what they know and love to do
- To prevent scholarly careers from breaking due to unjustified atrocity
- To sustain Ukraine’s presence in the European Research Area and international scholarly community
- To benefit from a contribution of talented scholars in your institution or research team

## Whom should we support?

- Support for Ukrainians on all levels of scholarly career is welcome: students, PhD candidates, early career researchers and senior scholars

## When should we open the call for applicants?

- Right now or as soon as possible. People are fleeing the warzone and need some form of stability right away
- We recommend that the whole process of applying, evaluating, providing results and funding should be immediate or contained in a few weeks’ timespan

## How long should the support last?

- Given the uncertain situation we suggest that the support should be provided for the longest possible period, but not shorter than 3 months. This might include research visits, so that scholars gain time and means to apply for more stable positions or grants

## What else can I do?

- If you know about positions with immediate availability dedicated to Ukrainian researchers which are not already in our database, please retweet using the hashtag [#ScienceForUkraine](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ScienceForUkraine) and submit the position via the [web form](https://scienceforukraine.eu/submit)
- If you want to join the #ScienceForUkraine team, please either get in touch with our [country's coordinator](https://scienceforukraine.eu/team.html) or, for counseling - Ukraine-based scholars, with [Oleksandra Ivashchenko](mailto:info@scienceforukraine.eu)
- Amplify our messages by sharing the listings relevant for your discipline or community
- If you are a coordinator of a national or discipline-specific agency or organization, please get in touch so that we can list you
- Raise awareness among prospective funders and receivers
- Your institution can endorse #ScienceForUkraine to provide more visibility for it
