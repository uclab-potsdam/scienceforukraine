We are collecting opportunities which were exclusively created for scientists affected by the war in Ukraine or those in which they are encouraged to apply. Industrial R&D or similar positions are also welcome. This includes positions that relate to _paid positions_ or other forms of support that normally _costs money_ and which are dedicated to scholars and students affiliated to an academic institution in Ukraine.

Examples include:

*   Fellowship/scholarship
*   Research visit
*   Part time/full time employment
*   Accommodation in a dormitory or institution guest quarters
*   Support for accompanying family members
*   Office space
*   Computer with internet access
*   Access to library and/or lab facilities

Possibilities for **remote work** are particularly relevant as well. Please see [this letter](https://scienceforukraine.eu/assets/YSC_letter.pdf) of the Young Scientists Council at the Ministry of Education and Science in Ukraine to the Polish National Science Center and #ScienceForUkraine [press release](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KIO96sfir9oPkVOOKtxXzzx4iPr2_d_-/view) on remote work opportunities.

Support for Ukrainians on all levels of scholarly career is welcome: students, PhD candidates, early career researchers and senior scholars.
