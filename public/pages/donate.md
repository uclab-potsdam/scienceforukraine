#ScienceForUkraine warmly welcomes donations made through PayPal or bank transfers to the association's bank account. Every contribution is highly appreciated and will greatly support the organization's sustainability as well as the realization of its goals.

In 2024, our objective is to establish a scholarship program for students and scholars in Ukraine, or internationally displaced scholars affiliated with Ukrainian academic institutions. The program will entail academic travel grants, covering accommodation and travel expenses associated with active (presenting poster/oral presentation) participation in international conferences and symposia. Results of the support program will be published in the annual report of #ScienceForUkraine. 

By supporting this initiative you are helping us support and sustain Ukrainian academic society.
