# What do we do with the money?

**In 2024, we established a **[#ScienceForUkraine Micro Travel Grant Programme](./mtg)** for scholars affiliated with Ukrainian academic institutions**. The program will support academic trips, covering accommodation and travel expenses associated with active (presenting poster/oral presentation) participation in international conferences and other scientific events.

By supporting this initiative you are helping us support and sustain Ukrainian academic society.
