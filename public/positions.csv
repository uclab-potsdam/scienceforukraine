Our research group is conducting a large project (iBEAT), funded by the SNF, to clarify the role of interpersonal emotion regulation problems for adolescents and young adults with Loss of Control Eating (LOC). The project consists of a cross-sectional and a longitudinal questionnaire study, an App-based daily life study and a virtual reality (VR) laboratory experiment. In addition, we evaluate the efficacy of an internet-based cognitive behavioral treatment of transdiagnostic interventions targeting emotion regulation problems. \n\nWe could integrate a computer scientist or a mental health specialist into the project:  1) a computer scientist could contribute to the refinement of the internet-based interventions or to the development of Apps, supporting the transfer of interventions into daily life. 2) a mental or public health scientist, could contribute to any of the ongoing experimental, App-based or treatment related parts of the project. She or he could also develop an additional treatment module focusing, for example, on depressive or anxiety symptoms.\nA midterm goal of the collaboration could also be the translation of the treatment module into Ukrainian. The department will foster integration into the Swiss scientific network and post-graduate education. \nPlease send us your CV and a letter that briefly describes how you can imagine contributing to our project.
